<h1 class="h1">Introduction</h1>
<p>Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba (Urdu: اسلامی جمعیتِ طلبہ ) abbr. IJT is the largest student organisation in the world. It was founded by 25 students on 23 December 1947 at Lahore, Pakistan.[2] Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba is working in Pakistan to eliminate the non-Islamic elements and secularism from the curriculum and teachings of the educational institutions of Pakistan.[3][4][5] It is a member of the International Islamic Federation of Student Organizations and the World Assembly of Muslim Youth.

    IJT was influenced mainly by the works of the late Syed Abul-Ala Maududi and Maulana Naeem Siddiqui.[6] It is an Islamic organization whose stated mission is to preach Islam to students of modern institutions throughout Pakistan. From the 1970s until about the early 1990s it was also the main ideological engine powering the concept of political Islam on the country's university and college campuses. It attempts to promote its vision of Islamic values and glorify the image of Islam through various means.[7] Its main fields are the modern educational institutions, i.e. colleges and universities across Pakistan, though many local sub-divisions are active at the school level, like Bazm-e-Sathi, Bazm-e-Paigham, Bazm-e-Roshni.[8][9]</p>

<h1 class="h2">History</h1>
<p>Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba was founded on 23 December 1947 in Lahore, and is one of the oldest student organizations in Pakistan. The headquarters of IJT is in the city of Lahore.[10] Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba's ideology is not based on any language and ethnic origin. The women's wing of the party, with the same ideology but with a separate structure and organisation, is known as Islami Jamiat-e-Talibaat.

    It has a counterpart of the same ideology but with a complete, separate and independent structure and organisation, known as Jamiat Talba Arbia Pakistan. (JT Arabia works in religious institutions of Pakistan.)[11]
    
    Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba is continuously struggling by keeping their voice up for the revival of students unions after the ban.[12]</p>
